V-Rising is a aesthetically stunning game that puts you in the cold flesh of a vampire that must explore the world, craft items, build a castle and slaughter masses to become the most powerful predator in the land.

The game is quite absent of a story but the stronger enemies or 'V-Bloods' have interesting information about them that makes slaying them so much more satisfactory.
The game is filled with dangers, beautiful environments, fantasy beasts, in depth crafting options, day and night cycle and more.

I was hesitant to delve into the V-Rising world as Battlerite is one of my all time favorite video games, and seeing how that was ultimately serviced, I was hesitant to pick up another SLS title. I will section this review off so you may skip around as you please.

Gameplay: 

From the moment I booted up the game, I could tell that SLS was serious about maintaining the aesthetic of their combat system throughout their titles, including V Rising. The combat in the vanilla game, and at the time of this review, more so in the Gloomrot beta, the combat feels clean, and very smooth. The interactions that you have with your abilities, as well as your combo potential all feel very natural and fluid. Pairing this with their WASD movement preference, and generous key-mapping options, the player is ultimately left feeling very comfortable, allowing for them to quickly start mastering the combat system. 

The depth of the combat, like BLC (Bloodline Champions), and Battlerite, has an incredibly high skill ceiling. Between learning your loadout rotations, mastering cancels, improving your aim, honing your CD temperament, and more, you will be left feeling satisfied for what feels like ever. And that is the absolute highest compliment I can give this game. It doesn't matter how good you are mechanically, or strategically, the game is rich and complex enough to offer anyone a challenge.

The day/night cycle is a nice addition to an open world survival game. Often times keeping the player on their toes, and keeping them aware of the time. I think I speak for every player when I say you can FEEL THE HEAT. The sun doesn't discriminate. If you're not pathing carefully, and staying alert, you will be crushed by the sun. The game is often times very fair with the sun placement, with the exception of a few areas feeling like genuine day-time traps. But given the design philosophy, you know, vampires and all, that seems fair. 
The addition of the sun can also impact combat, in both a fun, and sometimes frustrating way. It can be difficult to ascertain whether or not a boss or pack of mobs is doable given movement restrictions in some areas due to the sun. But often times, skilled players can maneuver with the shade, adapting quickly to complex situations regarding movement, which ultimately makes it fun in my opinion.

(Protip: use bat form during the day, the bat is invulnerable to the sun!)

The blood system was another unique component that I really enjoyed. At the start, you are running on frailed blood, which gives no added bonuses to the player, however, as you progress you can feed on NPCs allowing for you to acquire more refined blood. The blood has different types that grant the player different advantages. Among the different types, there are also different qualities of those types. With this system, the player can have tons of fun taking blood from the vast enemies in a chance to get a buff that may be useful for bosses or PvP. There is a sense of rarity to 100% blood of any type which is really nice. It adds an element of excitement and urgency when you do find it. Do you take it or do make it a prisoner? All of these components blend very well with the rest of the game, adding another seamless level of complexity to the game.

Boss design: 

I would say the boss design overall is great. There are lots of bosses that each test different aspects of your skill. With most bosses feeling absolutely unique and engaging. The environments that the bosses are in are often times quite interesting within themselves, and they allow the player to utilize them to gain an advantage over the boss, which for the most part, is overlooked in games in my personal opinion. 

Some of the bosses do seem to have ads in excess, and for those of you that don't know what ads are, they are minions/trash mobs. It can sometimes feel like the quality of a good boss fight is hampered by the fact that you are being dealt a bad hand at the expense of a trash mob(s). Personally it felt as though a few bosses could use AI improvement at the same time see a cutback on their ad spawning. 

One of the glaring issues with bosses, especially on increased difficulty mods, is the reliance on soloing bosses. Most bosses are designed for a solo, at most duo encounter. Beyond that, you are hampering your chances at successfully killing the boss immensely. For example, Nicholaus the Fallen is not feasible with more than 1 person due to the fact that the minion scaling, and HP scaling become completely absurd. This can take away from the enjoyment factor of playing with friends. And on competitive PvP servers almost guarantees that only 1 of your teammates is going to be doing the boss, which can be deemed boring.

World/Area Design:

I would give the map a solid score, too. I think overall the entire world immerses you quite well. There are tons of scenic vistas you'll be able to appreciate, in a world that was carefully curated, and designed with an emphasis on a good color palette, and enough gloom to make you feel like you're in a world run by vampires. The 4 zones (we'll exclude Gloomrot) all have really great differences, and are large enough for the player to explore for hours. Each bidding their own challenges. 

The material grind in each area can be relatively brutal, or easy depending on your sever settings. With a world filled with tons of unique items, everything has value, and I mean everything. One of my favorite aspects of this game is the the fact that every item is important in some way or another, so material grinding never feels pointless. Which in turn, raises the enjoyment factor. It's like getting shot with tiny bits of dopamine here and there as your playing, keeping you invested and interested the entire time. Which to me is an undervalued aspect of open-world games. Nothing feels worse than grinding for materials that ultimately don't matter down the line. 

I think the sheer size of the game is great, too. Each zone felt perfectly right in size, and never felt too bland or compact. The design plan was executed well and the picture is understood from the player's standpoint in terms of the geographical aspects.

Abilities/Weapons:

V Rising offers a large list of unique abilities that are interchangeable with one another, allowing the player to experiment with lots of different build ideas. This paired with other players playing alongside you, results in tons of combo potential and play-style potential in both the PvE and PvP environment. However, there are some things that should be mentioned.

A big issue with V Rising (pre-Gloomrot) is the obvious over-tuning of certain abilities. This results in what you'd expect. In a PvP setting especially, players opt to use the most powerful builds to maximize efficiency and their chance of winning. While that is natural, the game really only has a few notable builds, making the PvP combat feel incredibly stale after only a few sessions. This is less evident in PvE, so if you're not interested in PvP, you will likely not feel the effects of this.

The weapons in V Rising can best be described as simple. This is in no regard an insult, as the simplicity paired with the other factors of combat result in its seamless depth. With weapons having no more than 2 abilities, it allows for non-experienced and experienced players alike to enjoy and the learn the weapons without feeling overwhelmed. The abilities themselves are cool and unique as well. All of which fair well in both PvP and PvE environments. Each weapon really feels like it has value, and the added bonus of being able to seamlessly swap between them adds incredible depth without sacrificing simplicity. Again, add the fact that you will have friends with you, and then add spells, and you have a really nice blend for combat.",1684295972,1684304990,True,4,0,0.565217375755310059,2,True,False,True,True,

BUT WAIT, THERE’S MORE!

In this era of poor ports, Day One DLC, lockbox gambling, FOMO exploitation, Pay-2-Win mechanics, and predatory publishers, it’s incredibly important to have a developer who actually shows they give a shit not only about the quality of their product, but about their customers. 

Enter Stunlock Studios, a lovely group of folks who have developed a very simple premise into a game which was already quite enjoyable (eating up over 100 hours of my time) before the latest update. If they had never added anything else to it I would have still called it a game well worth my time and money, but then they announced their first major expansion.  

A lot of people asked “How can you have an expansion in an early access game?”  We all feared we were about to be charged an arm and a leg for some new DLC when the game wasn’t even officially released. Then the information arrived, this was a true EXPANSION OF THE GAME, not a DLC, not new content at a price, no, it was updated maps, updated weapons, an overhaul of systems under the hood, an entirely new method of building castles, a whole new string of bosses and a whole new area of the world, and it would cost us all… Nothing!  Nothing? NOTHING!

A free expansion of much needed Quality of Life updates alongside amazing new additions to the game play and aesthetic designs of the game. Then came the launch day for the new expansion and… It worked.  No server crashes. No hiccups. No false starts.  It worked from the word go!  It’s an S-Tier expansion with the devs being johnny on the spot whenever we players found bugs or issues. They’ve already done their first QoL patch for little snafus just two days later.

I cannot express how wonderful it is to have a dev team that’s response, cares about their player base, and was willing to take as much time as they needed to deliver an top notch expansion update to their game with as few bugs on release as humanly possible. 

Cheers to StunLock, cheers to V Rising, and cheers to proper commerce and interactions between product maker and product consumer.

The combat is fun and fluid, the mechanics are interesting, and the map is nice. But I don't know if I can recommend this game if you are a solo, especially if you're interested in PvP, which at it's core is what I believe this game was designed around. The resource grind is a bit slow, and craft times are annoying. But that's not even to mention other players.

If you deign to play on a PvP server, be prepared to lose every skirmish you get into, especially as a solo. Servers that are advertised as solo/duo often still have groups of 3+ running around, and with no way to report them or any admins, they go unpunished. Honestly the rat poly-morph should have been the first power you received because you cannot outrun them and you CERTAINLY cannot fight them, which leads me to my next topic.

Gear discrepancy is the most unbalanced I've ever seen in a survival game, but I guess that's the draw for a large amount of the player-base. Get geared and go grief lower levels to inflate your ego. It makes me wish the zones were segmented based on level (Perhaps with some kind of zone event or bounty system allowing access to the next zone?), but that would divide the already small player-base. You cannot run from higher level players because they have access to better mobility spells and a horse that is faster than the wolf form you start with. You cannot fight them because, true to the developer's name, they will stunlock you and kill you in 4-5 hits while you deal next to no damage what-so-ever. The only advice I can offer is stay OFF the main roads at ALL COSTS until you're confident you can fight them. Find other ways around the map, and rush for the rat poly-morph spell ASAP, it is the best hiding tool in the game. That and pray your base isn't found while you try to sleep or work. Even then finding a good location for your base is difficult, as most spots are taken in the starting zone and that seems to be where the higher level players patrol the most looking for easy kills. They will grief you, they will take your blueprints that they do not need just to deny you access to them, and they will raid your base regardless of what's inside.

As for the PvE, it's ight. Not hard though, at all. The only time I struggled was when a mob was much higher level than me, and even then it's doable. If you're ever close to dying just run away, most mobs won't be able to catch you. Bosses are kinda cool, but again not hard. The only stressful part in my experience is running back with all the loot in hopes of not finding another group of players. If you want a challenge go fight bosses when they're still a handful of levels above you I guess.",1684097222,1684097569,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True,True,

V Rising has an immersive atmosphere, great combat, and the amount of content and replay value makes the very reasonable cost of this game seem like a huge bargain, especially since more free content is about to be added a week from now in the Gloomrot update. 519 hours in game at the time of writing, highly recommended.",1683802921,1683802921,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True,True,

Especially because it has co-op functionality.
It's been a very long time since i played an open-world, objective based RPG, that did not feel in the least bit grindy.
Whether solo or with friends, every time I leave the castle, it feels like a little adventure. Prepare for the boss fight (the objective), get appropriately geared, (skills, pots, blood type) and head out. If you return successful, not only have you unlocked new skills and recipes, but you also always have a ton of mats to craft new stuff, as well as more of the old stuff. Very rarely will you need to go farming for specific mats, so long as you dont go full stealth and just go kill the boss and return. And preparing for a boss, or opening a new area, is also a rewarding task in itself.

I have over 200 hours played. So far I've played PVP on release and 2 PVE playthroughs, 2 months after release and now almost one year later. All playthroughs I had reached the maximum level gear and killed all bosses.

It's an interesting game to say the least. I love building in games in general so I was sold immediately.
I saw a lot of reviews mentioning the decay system and that it is horrible, which I see why they say that, At mid-end game all it takes is maybe 30 minutes of killing mobs to feed your castle to the max. On a level 2 Castle (which is so easy to get) it is about 5,5 days. At max lvl castle (Level 4) It's 12 days. Imo its not that bad. 

All in all I really like this game, It has decent mechanics when it comes to bosses, nothing over the top. 
The game can be difficult at times if you pull to much mobs so really, you can play however you want. 
Ez mode? Pull mobs one at a time. Up for a challenge? Just run in the camp without thinking.

1.) It is meant to be played cooperatively, so single players will want to modify the details and characteristics of their sole serve to make it less grindy.

2.) This game's controls, thou finicky, are relatively good but can be a bit of a issue for newer players.

3.) Bosses and enemies in this game can be very tricky for new players; and new players may wander into an area where higher level opponents will mop the floor with them.

4.) This point is more for the older players who purchased the bundle edition prior to the Gloomrot update. But the purchasing of the original bundle won't give you the new Gloomrot cosmetics for free. You need to purchase it, but it'll be at a 10% discount if you purchased the original bundle.

5.) This game is really what you make of it. It can be a building game for some, a multiplayer game to others, or a over-powered vampire lord simulation for another. 

6.) Frame rate issues can be a big issue and my computer froze upon changing the settings in options. So proceed with caution. 

7.) Be sure to adjust your graphical and game play settings prior to beginning a game. This is to ensure your computer functions normally and that the game is still playable without bricking your system.

Overall, is the game good? Yes! However, the beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so my opinion is not the end all be all for reviews.

It's a quite unique mix to be fair, but it works really well imho.

Game was already providing great value for its price, but the recent Gloomrot update made it much better by adding QoL changes so much needed: not having to walk half map to bring a thrall back to your remote located base, more mats now can be moved through portals, more doable farming of certain mats in early/mid stages of the game (bone dust f.i), the skill revamp allowing for new fun builds, and a long list of other improvements you may not be able to tell if you didn't play before Gloomrot.

All that on top of the new content mentioned already in their site, which is also really cool (specially 3-floor castles for building fans) and felt polished so far.

Also, for those concerned, you can play Vrising solo, the game doesn't force you to be in party in order to do any content. With the new changes farming isn't even a chore anymore at any stage; not that I could tell at least. PVP is also fun, albeit I don't recommend it if you won't be able to play on a daily basis, kinda like any other pvp survival game.. multi-floor castles should also make raiding quite harder now, but idk.

From the moment I stepped foot into this dark, immersive world, I was captivated by its unique concept and stunning visuals. As a vampire, you are tasked with rising from the grave and carving out your destiny in an unforgiving realm where darkness reigns supreme.

One of the first things that struck me about V Rising was its breathtaking graphics. The attention to detail in the environments, character models, and atmospheric effects is truly exceptional. The game effortlessly captures the eerie essence of being a creature of the night, with moonlit forests, gothic architecture, and haunting dungeons that create an immersive and atmospheric experience like no other.

The gameplay mechanics in V Rising are also praiseworthy. As you progress, you have the freedom to shape your vampire's abilities, choosing between different skill trees and playstyles. Whether you prefer to be a stealthy predator, a powerful sorcerer, or a fearsome warrior, the game accommodates various playstyles, allowing you to tailor your character to your preferred approach.

Another standout feature of V Rising is its robust and dynamic open-world. The map is vast and filled with diverse locations, each with its own secrets, challenges, and opportunities. From ancient crypts teeming with undead creatures to human settlements ripe for plunder, there is always something new to discover or conquer. After this most recent Gloomrot update, the world feels even more alive with more dense areas in terms of enemies and interest points.

Furthermore, the game's progression system is both rewarding and engaging. As you explore and complete quests, you gather resources that can be used to enhance your vampire's abilities, craft powerful weapons, and customize your lair. The sense of growth and accomplishment as you become more formidable is incredibly satisfying and keeps you motivated to push further into the darkness.

The cooperative gameplay elements in V Rising also deserve a mention. While you can certainly venture forth alone, the game truly shines when you team up with other players to tackle challenging bosses or engage in epic pvp battles. The sense of camaraderie and strategic coordination required to overcome formidable foes adds a layer of social interaction and excitement to the experience.

In conclusion, V Rising is a darkly beautiful, immersive, and exhilarating vampire-themed game that offers a fresh and captivating experience for players. Its stunning graphics, versatile gameplay mechanics, expansive open world, rewarding progression system and cooperative gameplay elements make it a true gem in the gaming world. Embrace your immortality and prepare to conquer the night in V Rising - you won't be disappointed!",1684506899,1684506899,True,1,0,0.505766034126281738,0,True,False,True,True,

If you love survival games, this game has got you covered. Countless hours of content await you here (trust me I'd know). The boss fights in this game are amazing as well, getting you to plan ahead and upgrade your gear before you can take them on. This game has SO many different things you can discover and provides a new experience every day. I'm still playing the first world I created at the time of writing this too.

I know it can't last forever but... it feels like it does. If you eventually run out of things to do on a world, there are different difficulties for you to try which change the game hugely and add tonnes of new loot (which will probably double my play time when I get to that haha).

You want an easy answer, buy the game, and here's why:

-The most replayable game on the market, I have done dozens of of playthroughs and it never gotten stale (partially from the class system, difficulty modifiers, and random world generation which can make each playthough different and interesting.) I'm gonna say it, its more replayable and definetly more bang for your buck than Minecraft, although those are just two factors.

-Cheap. 1/3 the price of great games like Minecraft while being just as good. You can make 10 bucks in 30 mins and though that hundreds of hours of fun.

-Multiplayer. Buy the game for a friend, you will have guaranteed fun, My first few playthoughs where with my siblings and friends and I still remember the fun we had.

-Modding. Finally getting tired of the game? Terrraria's modding scene is excellent and there as plenty of great Terraria mods worth more hours (may I suggest calamity ;)

You can do a lot in this good game.

Dig for shiny ores in the early game. [Watch out for traps in those caves]
Fight monsters, some raid events, and entire bosses. With a whole lot of weapons for it.
Probably the most weapons i will ever see in a game.
The PVP is very broken on some classes... but its Better off to just play a co-op SMP Server with own friends.
Explore? Well you can create a random worldgen. and there is custom maps and modding support to make that better
You can make amazing buildings if you can afford the blocks for it. you should probably find a way to get those blocks free.

[i]Fidel Dungeon Rescue[/i] is a rather clever, accessible roguelite turn-based puzzler.
Guide Fidel the corgi through various dungeon floors on a granny rescue mission. On his way Fidel levels up by beating enemies to gain additional HP, and picks up gold to power up special abilities. Usually you can't perfectly clear a level, so the game's all about maximizing gains within a limited (by a Spelunky-like ghost appearing on the floor if the player lingers for too long) time frame. There's a good variety of enemy types and objects, often requiring a special approach to tackle them. In a standard for some roguelites fashion you aren't provided with a lot of info on the game rules, instead discovering stuff through failure. It could've been annoying in a puzzle game, but, luckily, you can always undo and retrace your steps.

Level layouts are randomly generated, but follow strict templates, which somewhat harms replayability. So floor number 4 is always the ""alien"" level and so on. On the plus side, said templates often have unique mechanics, making a single run diverse.

Again, replayability appears to be [i]Fidel's[/i] weaker point, but there're hidden levels, characters and game modes to unlock, daily challenges, decent chunk of content overall. The graphics are cute, the soundtrack is actually great, play sessions are conveniently short. Overall, a pretty good indie title.

[h1]Daft Review[/h1] 
[b]Disclaimer: I was Fidel's stunt double during the making of the game. So when you see Fidel jumping through lava and eating spiders, yeah, that's actually me. [/b]

[i]Fidel Dungeon Rescue [/i] is an action-packed hardcorgi simulator. Battle ghouls, chase gnomes, play chess, fetch ball,  invade hell in this 100% authentic corgi experience. An amazing adventure. A normal day in a life of a corgi.
Ladies and gentlemen, you can play as a fat corgo. Or as a robo corg. OR as a zombie puppo. There's a dedicated bark button, incredible attention to crucial detail.
Family-friendly game: great way for your kids to learn about the sacrifices corgis make to protect and preserve humanity. 
Be a good dog, be a bad dog, be a dead dog, all major corgi archetypes are covered in this simulator, woofin' great.",1530448771,1530465937,True,14,5,0.683156192302703857,0,True,False,False,False,

You gain items and health for doing earlier floors better, so performance on early floors affects your ability on later ones, and even when you can't figure out the perfect solution you're always pressured to do as well as you possibly can.

The randomly generated levels will occasionally throw you a floor you can wipe in one try out of instinct, and occasionally something that has you completely stuck, which can be demoralizing near the end of a good run. There's also a timer on each level, which I guess is there to make sure you can't be TOO cautious, but getting wrecked by a ghost when you're 3/4ths of the way through a tricky level can feel frustrating all the same.

Game mechanics are all simple and self-explanatory (in fact there's almost no text except for menus), but they combine to make very tricky puzzles. There's a good variety of enemies, introduced at a steady pace, who all bring a creative twist that you must account for.

The difficulty is very high, demanding you do well on every level or you won't be able to beat the later ones (especially the brutal boss levels).

[i]Fidel Dungeon Rescue[/i] is a rather clever, accessible roguelite turn-based puzzler.
Guide Fidel the corgi through various dungeon floors on a granny rescue mission. On his way Fidel levels up by beating enemies to gain additional HP, and picks up gold to power up special abilities. Usually you can't perfectly clear a level, so the game's all about maximizing gains within a limited (by a Spelunky-like ghost appearing on the floor if the player lingers for too long) time frame. There's a good variety of enemy types and objects, often requiring a special approach to tackle them. In a standard for some roguelites fashion you aren't provided with a lot of info on the game rules, instead discovering stuff through failure. It could've been annoying in a puzzle game, but, luckily, you can always undo and retrace your steps.

Level layouts are randomly generated, but follow strict templates, which somewhat harms replayability. So floor number 4 is always the ""alien"" level and so on. On the plus side, said templates often have unique mechanics, making a single run diverse.

Again, replayability appears to be [i]Fidel's[/i] weaker point, but there're hidden levels, characters and game modes to unlock, daily challenges, decent chunk of content overall. The graphics are cute, the soundtrack is actually great, play sessions are conveniently short. Overall, a pretty good indie title.

[h1]Daft Review[/h1] 
[b]Disclaimer: I was Fidel's stunt double during the making of the game. So when you see Fidel jumping through lava and eating spiders, yeah, that's actually me. [/b]

[i]Fidel Dungeon Rescue [/i] is an action-packed hardcorgi simulator. Battle ghouls, chase gnomes, play chess, fetch ball,  invade hell in this 100% authentic corgi experience. An amazing adventure. A normal day in a life of a corgi.
Ladies and gentlemen, you can play as a fat corgo. Or as a robo corg. OR as a zombie puppo. There's a dedicated bark button, incredible attention to crucial detail.
Family-friendly game: great way for your kids to learn about the sacrifices corgis make to protect and preserve humanity. 
Be a good dog, be a bad dog, be a dead dog, all major corgi archetypes are covered in this simulator, woofin' great.",1530448771,1530465937,True,14,5,0.683156192302703857,0,True,False,False,False,

You gain items and health for doing earlier floors better, so performance on early floors affects your ability on later ones, and even when you can't figure out the perfect solution you're always pressured to do as well as you possibly can.

The randomly generated levels will occasionally throw you a floor you can wipe in one try out of instinct, and occasionally something that has you completely stuck, which can be demoralizing near the end of a good run. There's also a timer on each level, which I guess is there to make sure you can't be TOO cautious, but getting wrecked by a ghost when you're 3/4ths of the way through a tricky level can feel frustrating all the same.
